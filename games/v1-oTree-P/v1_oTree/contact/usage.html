<p>Dear Participants,</p>

    <p>Thank you for taking the time to complete our survey. Your input is invaluable to us.</p>

    <p>
        We understand that distractions can happen to anyone,
        and sometimes we may not answer every question as carefully as we'd like.
        If you feel that you may have not given your full attention to the questions,
        don't worry! Please take a moment to reflect and, if needed,
        let us know if you didn't take the questions as seriously as you'd like.
        We appreciate your honesty. The implementation of the game will be held
        separately and your likelihood to be selected will not be influenced by
        your answer to that question.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for your understanding and participation!</p>
