    <h2>Instructions for the Task</h2>

    <p><strong>Task Overview:</strong> In this task, you have been randomly paired with an anonymous person that will be referred to as "the other." Your choices and identity will remain completely confidential.</p>

    <p>You will be presented with a series of decisions regarding the allocation of resources between yourself and the other person. Please use the slider to mark your preferred distribution for each question; you can only make one mark per question.</p>

    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Your decisions will not impact the monetary outcomes for both you or the other person. This game is irrelevant for the Prolific bonus payment mentioned earlier. There are no right or wrong answers; this task is about personal preferences.</p>
